[![Javadoc](https://javadoc-emblem.rhcloud.com/doc/org.liquibase/liquibase-groovy-dsl/badge.svg)](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.liquibase/liquibase-groovy-dsl)

A pluggable parser for [Liquibase](http://liquibase.org) that allows the creation of changelogs in
a Groovy DSL, rather than hurtful XML. If this DSL isn't reason enough to adopt Liquibase, then
there is no hope for you.  This project was started once upon a time by Tim Berglund, and is
currently maintained by Steve Saliman.

**Important note for Groovy 4 and build tools:**
This DSL is built with a transitive dependency on Groovy 3.0.15.  This ensures that Gradle and Maven
users don't need to include Groovy in the classpath for the DSL to work, but because Groovy moved 
into the Apache foundation for version 4, and changed the artifact group, users who want to use
Groovy 4 need to exclude the transitive dependency.  Here is an example of how users of the
Liquibase Gradle plugin can do it:
```groovy
  liquibaseRuntime('org.liquibase:liquibase-groovy-dsl:3.0.3') {
    exclude group: "org.codehaus.groovy", module: "groovy"
    exclude group: "org.codehaus.groovy", module: "groovy-sql"
  }
liquibaseRuntime "org.apache.groovy:groovy:4.0.5"
liquibaseRuntime "org.apache.groovy:groovy-sql:4.0.5"
```

## News
### March 12, 2023
- Added support for Liquibase 4.16.

- Added support for Groovy 4 (#53), with thanks to Bj√∏rn Vester (@bjornvester)

### June 12, 2021
Fixed a bug with change log parameters (#50)

### April 16, 2021
Version 3.0.1 of the Liquibase Groovy DSL is now available with support for  Liquibase 4.2.2.

### September 5, 2020
Version 3.0.0 of the Liquibase Groovy DSL is now available with support for Liquibase 4.0.0.

As you might expect for a major release, this means some breaking changes.   There are two breaking
changes with this release.

Version 3.0.0 of the DSL no longer supports the 3.x releases of Liquibase.  If you need to use an
older version of Liquibase, you'll need an older version of the DSL.

Liquibase 4.0.0 no longer supports using absolute filenemes, so the DSL doesn't either.  This change
only affects changelogs that were using the `include` and `includeAll` elements with absolute paths.
 
### June 6, 2020
Release 2.1.2 is a minor release that fixes an issue with `include` and `includeAll` changes nested
inside change logs that used the previously added `logicalFilePath` support.

### January 25, 2020
Added support for an undocumented ChangeSet attribute.  The XML accepts an attribute named
`logicalFilePath`.  The actual ChangeSet property in the source code is named `filePath`.  The
Groovy DSL now supports both.  The default is still to inherit the filePath from the
DatabaseChangeLog.  This resolves Issue #45. The bugs in Liquibase 3.7+ still remain as of
Liquibase 3.8.5, so use those versions with care.

## Usage
Simply include this project's jar file in your class path, along with a version of Liquibase, a
version of Groovy, and your database driver, and Liquibase can parse elegant Groovy changelogs
instead of ugly XML ones.

If you are running Liquibase directly from the command line using the binary distribution of
Liquibase, you would need to copy the liquibase-groovy-dsl, groovy-x.y.z and database driver jar
files into the `lib` directory of the Liquibase distribution.  If you are running Liquibase using a
Gradle plugin, Maven plugin, or Spring Boot, follow the documentation of the tool to add these
artifacts to the classpath.  

The DSL syntax is intended to mirror the
[Liquibase XML](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/home.html)
syntax directly, such that mapping elements and attributes from the Liquibase documentation to
Groovy builder syntax will result in a valid changelog. Hence, this DSL is not documented separately
from the Liquibase XML format.  We will, however let you know about the minor differences or
enhancements to the XML format, and help out with a couple of the gaping holes in Liquibase's
documentation of the XML.

Note that wile the Groovy DSL fully supports using absolute paths for changelogs, we strongly
recommend using relative paths instead.  When Liquibase sees an absolute path for a changelog, all
changes included by that changelog will also have absolute path names, even if the `include` or
`includeAll` element used the `relativeToChangeLog` attribute.  This will cause problems in 
multi-developer environments because the difference in the users' directories will cause Liquibase
to think that the changes are new, and it will try to run them again.

##### Deprecated and Unsupported Items
- Liquibase has a `whereParam` element for changes like the `update` change. It isn't documented in
  the Liquibase documentation, and I don't see any benefits of using it over the simpler `where` 
  element, so it has been left out of the Groovy DSL.

- In the Liquibase XML, you can set a `sql` attribute in a `sqlFile` change, but that doesn't make a
  lot of sense, so this has been disabled in the Groovy DSL.

- The documentation mentions a `referencesUniqueColumn` attribute of the `addForeignKeyConstraint`
  change, but what it doesn't tell you is that it is ignored.  In the code, Liquibase has marked
  this item as being deprecated, so we've deprecated it as well, and we let you know about it.

- If you were using the DSL prior to version 1.0.0, a changeSet could have an `alwaysRun` property.
  This is inconsistent with Liquibase and has been replaced in 1.0.0 with `runAlways`

- Prior to 1.0.0, the DSL allowed a `path` attribute in an `include`.  This is no longer allowed.
  `includeAll` should be used instead.

- Prior to 1.0.0, the DSL allowed `createStoredProcedure` changes.  This has been replaced with
  `createProcedure`.

- Prior to 1.0.0, the DSL allowed a File object to be passed as an attribute to `loadData` and
  `loadUpdateData` changes.  This is no longer supported, the path to the file should be used
  instead.

- Prior to 1.0.0, the DSL allowed constraint attributes to be set as methods in a constraint
  closure.  This is inconsistent with the rest of the DSL and has been removed.

- Prior to 2.0.0, the DSL used the `resourceFilter` attribute of the `includeAll` element to filter
  the changelogs included in a directory.  This has been changed to `filter` to remain consistent
  with Liquibase itself.

##### Additions to the XML format:
- In general, boolean attributes can be specified as either strings or booleans. For example,
  `changeSet(runAlways: 'true')` can also be written as `changeSet(runAlways: true)`.

- The Groovy DSL supports a simplified means of passing arguments to the `executeCommand change`.
  Instead of:

```groovy
execute {
  arg(value: 'somevalue')
}
```
You can use this the simpler form:
```groovy
execute {
  arg 'somevalue'
}
```

- The `sql` change does not require a closure for the actual SQL.  You can just pass the string like
  this: `sql 'select some_stuff from some_table'`.  If you want to use the `comments` element of a
  `sql` change, you need to use the closure form, and the comment must be in the closure BEFORE the
  SQL, like this:

```groovy
sql {
  comment('we should not have added this...')
  'delete from my_table'
}
```

- The  `stop` change can take a message as an argument as well as an attribute.  In other words,
  `stop 'message'` works as well as the more XMLish `stop(message: 'message')`

- A `customPrecondition`  can take parameters.  the XMLish way to pass them is with
  `param(name: 'myParam', value: 'myValue')` statements in the customPrecondition's closure.  In the
  Groovy DSL, you can also have `myParam('myValue')`

- The `validChecksum` element of a change set is not well documented.  Basically you can use this
  when changeSet's current checksum will not match what is stored in the database. This might happen
  if you, for example want to reformat a changeSet to add white space.  This doesn't change the
  functionality of the changeset, but it will cause Liquibase to generate new checksums for it.  The
  `validateChecksum` element tells Liquibase to consider the checksums in the `validChecksum`
  element to be valid, even if it doesn't match what is in the database.

- The Liquibase documentation tells you how to set a property for a databaseChangeLog by using the
  `property` element.  What it doesn't tell you is that you can also set properties by loading a
  property file.  To do this, you can have `property(file: 'my_file.properties')` in the closure for
  the databaseChangeLog.

- Liquibase has an `includeAll` element in the databaseChangeLog that includes all the files in the
  given directory.  The Groovy DSL implementation only includes groovy files, and it makes sure they
  are included in alphabetical order.  This is really handy for keeping changes in a different file
  for each release.  As long as the file names are named with the release numbers in mind, Liquibase
  will apply changes in the correct order.

- Remember, the Groovy DSL is basically just Groovy closures, so you can use groovy code to do
  things you could never do in XML, such as this:

```groovy
sql { """
  insert into some_table(data_column, date_inserted)
  values('some_data', '${new Date().toString()}')
"""
}
```

##### Items that were left out of the XML documentation
- The `createIndex` and `dropIndex` changes have an undocumented `associatedWith` attribute.  From
  an old Liquibase forum, it appears to be an attempt to solve the problem that occurs because some
  databases automatically create indexes on primary keys and foreign keys, and others don't.  The
  idea is that you would have a change to create the primary key or foreign key, and another to
  create the index for it.  The index change would use the `associatedWith` attribute to let
  Liquibase know that this index will already exist for some databases so that Liquibase can skip
  the change if we are in one of those databases.  The Liquibase authors do say it is experimental,
  so use at your own risk...

- The `executeCommand` change has an undocumented `os` attribute.  The `os` attribute is a string
  with  a list of operating systems under which the command should execute.  If present, the
  `os.name` system property will be checked against this list, and the command will only run if the
  operating system is in the list.

- The `column` element has some undocumented attributes that are pretty significant.  They include:
  * `valueSequenceNext`, `valueSequenceCurrent`, and `defaultValueSequenceNext`, which appear to
    link values for a column to database sequences.
  * A column can be set auto-number if the `autoIncrement` attribute is set to true, but did you
    know that you can also control the starting number and the increment interval with the 
    `startWith` and `incrementBy` attributes?
  * Since Liquibase 3.6, you can specify a `defaultValueConstraintName`.

- The `constraints` element also has some hidden gems:
  * Some databases automatically create indexes for primary keys. The `primaryKeyTablespace` can be
    used to control the tablespace.
  * A foreign key can be made by using the `references` attribute like this:
    `references: 'monkey(id)'`, It can also be done like this: 
    `referencedTableName: 'monkey', referencedColumnNames: 'id'` for those who prefer to separate
    out the table from the column. Since Liquibase 3.5, this second form also has
    `referencedTableCatalogName` and `referencedTableSchemaName` attributes.
  * There is also a `checkConstraint` attribute, that appears to be useful for defining a check
    constraint, but I could not determine the proper syntax for it yet.  For now, it may be best to
    stick to custom `sql` changes to define check constraints.
  * Since Liquibase 3.6, you can specify a name for a Not Null constraint with the
    `notNullConstraintName` attribute.

- The `createSequence` change has n `cacheSize` attribute that sets how many numbers of the sequence
  will be fetched into memory for each query that accesses the sequence.

- The documentation for version 3.1.1 of Liquibase mentions the new `beforeColumn`, `afterColumn`,
  and `position` attributes that you can put on a `column` statement to control where a new column
  is placed in an existing table.  What the documentation leaves out is that these attributes don't
  work :-)

- Version 3.4.0 of Liquibase introduced two new attributes to the `includeAll` element of a
  databaseChangeLog, both of which are undocumented.  The first one is the `errorIfMissingOrEmpty`
  attribute.  It defaults to `true`, but if it is set to `false`, Liquibase will ignore errors
  caused by invalid or empty directories and move on.  The second one is the  `resourceFilter`
  attribute.  A resourceFilter is the name of a class that implements
  `liquibase.changelog.IncludeAllFilter` interface, which allows developers to implement
  sophisticated logic to decide what files from a directory should be included (in addition to the
  .groovy extension filter that the Groovy DSL imposes). 

- Liquibase 3.5.0 renamed the `resourceFilter` of `includeAll` to just `filter`.  It also added
  `resourceComparator`, which lets you specify the name of a class that implements Comparator that
  will be used to determine how to sort files.  The default is to just sort them by name.

- Liquibase 3.4.0 added the undocumented `forIndexCatalogName`, `forIndexSchemaName`, and
  `forIndexName` attributes to the `addPrimaryKey` and `addUniqueConstraint` changes.  These
  attributes allow you to specify the index that will be used to implement the primary key and
  unique constraint, respectively.

- Liquibase 3.4.0 added the undocumented `cacheSize` and `willCycle` attributes to the
  `alterSequence`  change. `cacheSize` sets how many numbers of the sequence will be fetched into
  memory for each query that accesses the sequence.  `willCycle` determines if the sequence should
  start over when it reaches its maximum value.

- Liquibase 3.5.0 changed the `willCycle` attribute of `alterSequence` to be `cycle`.  It does the
  same thing, but it remains undocumented.

- Liquibase added the `context` attribute to the `include`, `includeAll`, and `changeLog` elements.
  They work the same as the context attribute of a change set.

- Liquibase 3.5 added `runOrder` and `created` attributes to the `changeSet` element.  `runOrder`
  lets you specify that a change set should always be first or last.  I have no idea what `created`
  does.

- Liquibase 3.6 added the `ignore` attribute to a change set, which seems to be a way to ignore a
  change set. 
 
- Liquibase 3.6 added `validate` and `clustered` to the `addUniqueConstraint` change.  `validate`
  tells the database to validate the constraint when it is first created, and `clustered` tells the
  database to use a clustered index.

- Liquibase 3.6 added `defaultValueConstraintName` to the `addDefaultValue` change to give the
  constraint being created a name.

- Liquibase 3.5 added `commentLineStartsWith` to the `loadData` change.  By default, Liquibase
  treats lines in the loaded file that start with a `#` to be comments.  `commentLineStartsWith`
  lets you change that.

- Liquibase 3.6 added `usePreparedStatements` to the `loadData` change.  When true, it tells
  Liquibase to use prepared statements in the inserts it generates.

- Liquibase 3.6 added `validate` to the `addForeignKeyConstraint` change to tell the database
  whether to validate a new constraint when it is made.

- Liquibase 3.6 added another way to create a view with the `createView` change.  Previously, the
  SQL to create the view was in the closure of the `createView` element.  Now you can specify a file
  with the SQL using the new `path`, `encoding`, and `relativeToChangelogFile` attributes.  I have
  no idea what happens if you specify both a path to a file and a closure with SQL.

- Liquibase 3.6 added a `timeout` to the `executeCommand` change.  It lets you specify a command
  timeout in seconds, minutes, or hours.  For example, to set a 2-minute timeout, you'd use `2m` as
  the value of the `timeout` attribute.

- The Liquibase XML accepts a `logicalFilePath` attribute for the `changeSet` element.  The actual
  property in the ChangeSet class is named `filePath`.  The Groovy DSL accepts both.  The default is
  to inherit the file path from the DatabaseChangeLog that contains the ChangeSet.

## TODOs

 * Support for the customChange. Using groovy code, liquibase changes and database SQL in a changeSet.
 * Support for extensions. modifyColumn is probably a good place to start.
